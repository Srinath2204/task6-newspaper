                    the highest single-day increase in cases since October 16, as the country’s second wave continued to

                    the 500,000-mark for the first time since November. As of Friday, there are 454,178 active cases in

                <h2>On historic visit, PM recalls his struggle for Bangladesh</h2>
                <p>HT Correspondent

                    letters@​hindustantimes.com
                    
                    New Delhi : India and Bangladesh must be prepared to confront shared threats such as terrorism even as they boost trade and connectivity, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday while participating in celebrations marking the golden jubilee of the neighbouring country’s independence, towards which he recalled his own contribution.
                    
                    On his first foreign visit since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, the PM said he had joined a movement for the liberation of Bangladesh when he was young and got arrested for it. “Joining that struggle for Bangladesh’s independence was one of the first times I joined such a movement in my life. I must have been 20-22 years old when many of my colleagues and I joined a satyagraha for the freedom of the people of Bangladesh,” he said.
                    
                    “I was arrested and had to go to jail. The yearning for Bangladesh’s independence was as great on this side as it was on the other side,” he said, speaking as a guest of honour at the main National Day celebration in Dhaka while sharing the stage with his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina.
                    
                    In a speech in Hindi peppered with Bengali words, Modi – clad in a black sleeveless jacket in a style made popular by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Father of the Nation of Bangladesh – made several references to the sacrifices made by Indian soldiers and Bangladeshi freedom fighters in the 1971 war that led to the emergence of a new country from the erstwhile East Pakistan.</p>

                <p>New Delhi/Mumbai : A total of 62,267 new infections of Covid-19 were reported across India on Friday, the highest single-day increase in cases since October 16, as the country’s second wave continued to push infection numbers up forcing states to reintroduce curbs on social gatherings ahead of Holi and the festive season. Active cases across the country, meanwhile, soared near the half million mark after a gap of over four months.

                    Maharashtra on Friday announced the imposition of a night curfew across the state starting Sunday in an attempt to curb the outbreak. The state reported 36,902 new cases – highest single-day increase ever. This is the sixth time in nine days that the state has set a new all-time record for daily cases.</p>

                <h2>Delhi road revamp project hits central govt roadblock</h2>
                <p>New Delhi : The Delhi government’s ambitious project to redesign 540km of the city roads, along the lines of those in European countries, has hit a roadblock days after the work began, with the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) on Thursday ordering an inquiry against the Delhi Public Works Department (PWD) for allegedly damaging trees and undertaking construction on a stretch of the Ring Road between Moti Bagh and Mayapuri demarcated as “deemed forest”.

                    Prachi Gangwar, deputy inspector general (forests), regional office of the Union environment ministry, on Thursday sent a letter to the principal chief conservator of forests, Delhi Forest Department, to file a report on the violations and the action taken against PWD for violating the Delhi Preservation of Trees (1994) Act.
                    
                    Delhi government spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.
                    
                    “You are requested to submit a factual report based on field inspection in reference of the complaint letter. In case a violation is reported in the matter, action is solicited as per the rules and guidelines of the MoEFCC,” read the letter from Gangwar.
                    
                    On March 12, the Forest Department issued a notice to PWD to stop work on a stretch of the Ring Road between south Delhi’s Moti Bagh and Mayapuri for allegedly damaging trees (during trenching) in an area which is a deemed forest. This stretch is among nine roads that are to be redesigned on a pilot basis, as part of the Delhi government’s “redesigning and street scaping of roads” plan, announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in 2019.</p>

                <h2>Centre wrote to Delhi govt over ‘ration quality’ in city</h2>
                <div class="c">
                <div class="c1">
                <p>New Delhi : A day before it red-flagged the Delhi government’s doorstep ration delivery scheme on March 19, the Union ministry of food and public distribution pulled up the state administration for “repeated delays” in submitting action-taken reports required to be filed on the use of electronic point of sale (e-POS) machines in ration shops and on improving the “quality” of subsidised foodgrains being disbursed in the Capital, according to government documents.

                    The ministry wrote two letters to the government on March 18. While one was a reminder to submit a report on the quality of foodgrains being distributed and on steps taken to remove discrepancies in the city’s public distribution system, the other was about a delay in the trial of e-POS machines in Delhi’s 2,000-odd fair price shops (FPS).
                    
                    HT has seen the documents.
                    
                    A day later, on March 19, the Union ministry raised objections to the doorstep ration delivery scheme, saying its name, cost and method of delivery were not in accordance with the National Food Security Act (NFSA).
                    
                    The Delhi government said that the Centre was trying to block its flagship scheme, and altered the name of the programme on March 24 so that it could be implemented.
                    
                    However, the Union government later said that there were other problems related to distribution. </p>
                </div>
                   <div class="c2">
                       <p> The second letter sent to the Delhi government on March 18 was a reminder asking it to respond to an October 23, 2020, letter from Union food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey to chief secretary Vijay Dev, which said that routine inspections at 71 fair price shops showed that 30% of ration being distributed in Delhi was unfit for consumption.
                    
                        The letter said that 90 of the 138 samples were beyond the rejection limit (BRL) as mandated by the Centre’s uniform specifications of foodgrains (wheat and rice). The letter also contended that 42 other samples (18 wheat and 24 rice) were “unfit for human consumption.”
                        
                        Delhi food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain said, “As far as the use of the e-POS machines in ration shops is concerned, the ONORC and door-to-door ration schemes in Delhi will be ensured in all ration shops. The state cabinet took this call, and it has been brought to the Centre’s notice,” he said.
                        
                        Hussain also said foodgrains being sent from the Centre’s godowns were of “poor quality.”</p>

            <div class="col-4">
                <p>Kolkata/Guwahati : Kicking off this season of assembly elections, voters in two of India’s largest eastern states, West Bengal and Assam, in substantially tribal-dominated districts, will begin the process of electing their local representatives on Saturday, with major national and regional parties — the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) — engaged in an intense battle to win or retain power.

                    The polls in Bengal will see Mamata Banerjee’s TMC attempt to defend its turf against a resurgent BJP, which won 18 of the 42 seats in the state in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and has emerged as the primary challenger. In Assam, it is the BJP which is seeking to retain power, as a coalition of the Congress and Badruddin Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) challenges the Sarbananda Sonowal-led government.</p>

                <p>New Delhi : A 12-hour Bharat Bandh called by farmer groups affected large parts of Punjab, Haryana, Bihar and western Uttar Pradesh with road and rail transport severely hampered, although the impact of the nationwide demonstration was largely limited in other regions of the country.

                    The bandh, called by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) to protest against the three contentious farm laws, was in force from 6am to 6pm. Dozens of farm leaders and activists were detained and the northern railways said 41 passenger trains and 40 freight trains had to be cancelled, diverted or delayed.</p>
